The majority of current ETAs are incapable of performing way-finding and route-following functions; instead, they are only intended to detect obstacles and provide feedback. Although certain ETAs, such as the recently introduced cactus tree-based algorithm, were designed with way-finding and route-following functions, obstacle detection and avoidance are frequently overlooked.We could see that there is a need for significant improvement in wearable ETAs and navigation by fusing ideas from the various concepts and techniques mentioned above, such as the concepts of user preferences in path planning algorithms and effective power management in the ETA.

In this Project We are using, 

Arduino Nano which is an intelligent development board designed for building faster prototypes with the smallest dimension and it acts as the heart of the device which consists of an ATmega328 microcontroller clocked at a frequency of 16 MHz,22 digital input/output pins, 8 analog pins, and a mini-USB port.

An ultrasonic sensor to detect impediments in the path to the destination.

GPS/Timer Peripherals is used for navigation to determine the best route based on the destination address. 

So, we propose a system that chooses the most preferable path for the user and manages the power such that minimum loss occurs in a cost-effective manner.

Recent study on developing an electronic travelling aid, reported that on average, 15% of visually impaired persons encounter obstacles each month, and 40% of them trip over them and fall. It could be seen that there is a need for significant improvement in wearable ETAs. Many visually challenged people are unable to avoid the obstacles while walking. Also, the location of these people needs to be tracked in real time for their safety purposes. By reviewing the literature on wearable ETAs it is found that a tracking system for caretakers to know the location of the visually impaired is been implemented less and needs improvement. For the above discussed difficulties, a wearable ETA which would ensure the impaired persons safety in their leisure walks in their well-known path is needed to be implemented along with obstacle detection.

In this Project We are using, 

1.ESP 12E (NODE MCU) microcontroller which is a low-cost Wi-Fi chip developed by Espressif Systems. It can be used as a standalone device, or as a UART to Wi-Fi adaptor to allow other microcontrollers to connect to a Wi-Fi network. For example, you can connect an ESP 12E to an Arduino to add Wi-Fi capabilities to your Arduino board. The most practical application is using it as a standalone device. With the ESP 12E, you can control inputs and outputs as you would do with an Arduino, but with Wi-Fi capabilities.

2.An ultrasonic sensor With a ranging precision of up to 3mm, the ultrasonic ranging module HC-SR04 offers a non-contact measurement capability across a range of 2 cm to 400 cm. Ultrasonic transmitter, receiver, and control circuits are all included in the modules.

3.NEO-7MV3 is a GPS (Global Positioning System) module and is used for navigation or location tracking.The module simply checks its location on earth and provides output data which is longitude and latitude of its position.It has a compact architecture, power and memory options making it ideal for battery operated mobile devices with very strict cost and space constraints.

4.A vibration motor that resemble coins which is a Eccentric Rotating Mass (ERM) motor is used as an actuator.

5.A smartphone to support the app built using MIT app inventor to be used by caretaker to track the blind user in case of emergency.

6.Firebase is a set of backend cloud computing services and application development platforms provided by Google which is used as cloud to store and retrive GPS data.

So an object detection and location tracking-based system is developed for the visually impaired in a cost-effective manner.It is linked wirelessly via IoT with a mobile phone. In the implementation, an Android application is designed using MIT App Inventor to enable the location of the user to his or her caretaker.
